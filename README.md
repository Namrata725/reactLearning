# React Project Setup with Vite

## Overview - React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive experience. It lets you build reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.

## Why React

- Component-based architecture
- Fast and efficient rendering with virtual DOM
- Large community and ecosystem
- Suitable for complex frontend applications

## Overview - Vite

Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It uses native ES modules and starts the server instantly.

## Why Vite

- Lightning-fast cold starts
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates
- Optimized build using Rollup
- Easy configuration for React and other frameworks

## Installation of Node.js and npm

Install Node.js (which comes with npm) from the official site:

https://nodejs.org/

## Why install Node.js and npm?

- **Node.js** is required to run JavaScript tools on your system.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)** is used to manage project dependencies like React, Vite, etc.

## Getting Started with React + Vite

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

# React + Vite Project Overview

This project is built using React.js and Vite.

## Folder & File Purpose

### node_modules/

- Automatically generated by npm.
- Contains all installed project dependencies.

### public/

- Stores static files that are directly served (like `favicon`, `robots.txt`).
- Not processed by Vite or React.

### src/

- Main source code folder for the React app.

#### src/assets/

- Stores static assets like CSS, images, or fonts used in the app.

#### App.jsx

- Main component that holds the structure of your application.

#### App.css

- Styles specifically for the `App.jsx` component.

#### index.css

- Global styles applied throughout the app.

#### main.jsx

- Entry point of the React app.
- Renders the `App` component into the DOM.

---

### index.html

- Main HTML file served to the browser.
- React is mounted inside the `<div id="root"></div>`.

### vite.config.js

- Configuration file for Vite (e.g., aliases, plugins, server settings).

### package.json

- Lists project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

### package-lock.json

- Auto-generated to lock dependency versions.

### .gitignore

- Specifies which files/folders Git should ignore.

### eslint.config.js

- Contains rules and configuration for linting JavaScript/JSX code.

### README.md

- This documentation file explaining the purpose of each part of the project.

## My First React Code

Once the project is set up, replace the content of `src/App.jsx` with the following code:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h2>This is my first React App</h2>
      <p>My name is namrata...</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


--------
```

## Adding a Reusable Header Component

Now let's organize our code by creating a separate `Header` component and using it inside the `App` component.

### `src/Header.jsx`

```jsx
function Header() {
  return <h1>Header</h1>;
}

export default Header;

import Header from './Header.jsx';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
        ..... other existing elemnts
          </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
